A C library and programs for working with VCF files

# Build from GitHub :floppy_disk:

## get_columns2

Shows only the columns you choose from a multi columns file (usually named cvs file). You have to choose the columns by numbers using the -f parameter. It works on a .vcf file and does not shows meta-information lines e.g. ##fileformat=VCFv4.2. 

Option | What does it do
------------ | -------------
-h | Show help
-d | The field delimiter to use instead of the tab character
-f | The fields to be shown (separated by ,)

##### Example
```console
>>> get_columns2   -f 2,1,3,4  input.txt
```

## get_pass_variants

This program filters a VCF file showing only the ones with PASS (annotated by [SnpEff](https://pcingola.github.io/SnpEff/)) in the FILTER field.

Option | What does it do
------------ | -------------
-h | Show help

##### Example

```console
>>> get_pass_variants mutations.vcf
```
## filter_vcf_by_bed

Filter a VCF file using a BED file.

Option | What does it do
------------ | -------------
-h | Show help
-a | show the header in the filtered VCF

```console
>>> filter_vcf_by_bed -a sample.bed variants.vcf
```
